***Titanic Survival Prediction ⛴️***

This project is a Titanic survival prediction model built using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The goal of this project is to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis and provides an excellent opportunity for beginners to get started with data science. 🚢

***Overview 📋***

In this project, we use the Titanic dataset to train and evaluate machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as:

- Passenger Class
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children Aboard)
- Ticket Number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Port of Embarkation
- who
- alone
- survived

The project includes the following key components:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
4. Machine Learning Model: Building and training a predictive model.
